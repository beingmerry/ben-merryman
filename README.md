Please see my GitHub for other projects I may be working on at https://github.com/beingmerry/

I use the repo and site for testing designs, building tools, and as my personal portfolio.  

# Goals
+ My goal is to try to push 1 update / day to a file in this repo.  
+ Build tools, build guides, build games!
+ Make it clean tuck away the utilities.

# Plans
Build out an interactive toolkit that will be expanded as I progress further in the course.  
+ Link to notes on the Web Share public view only platform to demo how I am learning and going through the course
++ See OneNote Folder
+ Share everything!
++ Trying to! Built out my LinkedIn and other social media for the big career change
+ Use the platforms that are already built for sharing. Don't reinvent the wheel
