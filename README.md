# Plans
Build out an interactive toolkit that will be expanded as I progress further in the course.  Also link to notes on the Web Share public view only platform to demo how I am learning and going through the course.  

Share everything!  

Use the platforms that are already built for sharing.
# OneNote Folder
I will try to share my notes from the Flatiron course as I take them. Feel free to download (will need OneDrive)
