# ben-merryman | Ben Merryman's Tools, Tips, Ideas, and Projects
Please see my GitHub for other projects I may be working on at https://github.com/beingmerry/

I use this repo and site (https://beingmerry.github.io/ben-merryman/) for testing designs, building tools, and as my personal portfolio.  

# Goals
+ My goal is to try to push 1 update / day to a file in this repo.  
+ Build tools, build guides, build games!
+ Make it clean, tuck away the utilities.
+ Get involved, be on the Slack daily answering questions, asking for help, and commenting on other people's ideas

# Plans (project ideas and logs)
### 🛠️ Build interactive toolkit
1. Demo ideas and showcase what I've learned
2. Easy start is mouse position shown on screen.
3. Add in a console like "viewport" site to showcase different CSS?
4. Have JavaScript "re-write" the CSS based off of button pushes similar to FreeCodeCamp

### 🏭 Liii.pdf online factory and control system demonstrations
1. "Lessons In Industrial Instrumentation" book
2. https://www.ibiblio.org/kuphaldt/socratic/sinst/book/liii.pdf4
3. "Online" factory that demo's core concept of control systems
4.  Tie in to a database? Build something persistent?
5.  Lots of interesting ideas that I worked with in engineering
6.  Would be fun to teach through an interactive web site
